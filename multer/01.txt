Multer
-> Middleware for handling multipart/form-data,
   which is used for uploading files in web application using express.js

Uses?
-> HTTP requests that send file use multipart/form-data encoding type
-> Express by itself cannot parse multipart/form-data
-> Multer processes this form data, extract files, and makes them accessible
   in your Express app via req.file or req.files

Working:
-> Multer intercepts incoming request with multipart/form-data
-> It parses the form data
-> it parses the form data
-> saves the files to disk or memory
-> attaches the file information to the request object

Real World:
-> uploading user profile picture
-> uploading documents or pdfs
-> handling multiple image uploads, for a gallery feature
-> validating file type and size before saving

Summary:
-> Multer is essential for handling file uploads in express
-> It parses multipart/form-data and saves files, to disk or memory
-> Provides flexible storage, file filtering, and size limits
-> used heavily in backend projects, with user upload concepts
