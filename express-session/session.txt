express-session
middleware in express.js
stores user-specific data on server 

-http is stateless(doesn't remember user between reQ)
-session solve this by giving each other unique session id
(usually stored in a cookie)
-session data is stored in server, and only the id is sent to client

why do we need it
- keep user logged in across pages
- to store temporary data like shopping cart item
- track user activity securely

how it works:
-login->server creates a session-> assigns unique sessionID
-session data is saved in memory, db or file
-subsequent requests, the browser sends the cookie
